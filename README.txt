 where you may log in with an existing UserName and Password as a Client or Employee

Logging in as A Client:
-After logging in with a valid Username and Password for a Client account then you will be brought to the main
 client view where you can see all of your appointments or just the ones of a specific day you select.
-From this page you may also Add and Delete appointments using their respective buttons. Each button will take you
 to a short form you must fill out before creating or deleting your appointment. (Reminder, when creating an appointment
 before sure to enter the time in the correct format XX:XX AM/PM)

 operation you wish to do and fill out the short form.(Reminder, when creating an appointment before sure to enter the
